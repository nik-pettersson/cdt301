Assumptions:
1. Conditionals without blocks are limited to one statement (as in C)
2. Conditionals without blocks can contain a combined if-else statement (exception to above)
3. A program must have at least one function (or is this semantics?)
4. Variables must be declared first in the function (not C99)
5. Relation operators can be chained, although the meaning will not be the same as mathematical chaining of relation operators (allowed in C)
